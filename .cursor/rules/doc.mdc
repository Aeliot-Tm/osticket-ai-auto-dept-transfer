Download descriptions from files IF you need to understand the work:
1. Architecture (Technical solutions):
   - (No feature documentation files yet)
2. Features:
   - [AI-Powered Department Selection]: .cursor/docs/Feature/AIPoweredSelection.md
   - [Automatic Ticket Transfer]: .cursor/docs/Feature/AutomaticTicketTransfer.md
   - [Content Analysis]: .cursor/docs/Feature/ContentAnalysis.md
   - [Department Rules Configuration]: .cursor/docs/Feature/DepartmentRulesConfiguration.md
   - [Manual Transfer Trigger]: .cursor/docs/Feature/ManualTransferTrigger.md
   - [Plugin Configuration]: .cursor/docs/Feature/PluginConfiguration.md

When updating functionality or when explicitly requested, update the corresponding documentation files.
   - First, business logic/steps with minimal technical details, then additional logic with minimal technical details,
     and finally, technical details (architecture, paths, settings, commands, etc.).
   - Update without blocks with the latest changes, as if you were doing it from scratch for complete documentation.
   - Keep documentation of Architecture (Technical solutions) in directory `.cursor/docs/Architecture` and add path to such file
     in section `1. Architecture (Technical solutions):` above like others.
   - Keep documentation of Features in directory `.cursor/docs/Feature` and add path to such file in section `2. Features:` above like others.

When creating new documentation files:
   - After creating a new Architecture documentation file, add a link to it in section `1. Architecture (Technical solutions):` above.
     Format: `- [Description]: .cursor/docs/Architecture/[FileName].md`
   - After creating a new Feature documentation file, add a link to it in section `2. Features:` above.
     Format: `- [Description]: .cursor/docs/Feature/[FileName].md`
   - Use relative paths from project root (starting with `.cursor/docs/`).
   - Keep entries in alphabetical order by description for better organization.
