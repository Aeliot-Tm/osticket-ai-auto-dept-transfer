## Plugin `osticket-ai-auto-dept-transfer`

- **Purpose**: Automatically determines the correct department for a ticket based on its content using AI and transfers the ticket to the appropriate department.
- **Where to apply these rules**: any changes under `include/plugins/osticket-ai-auto-dept-transfer/*`, including analyzer classes, configuration, and the rules UI.
- **What must be preserved**:
  - Do not change the storage format or interpretation of routing rules without migrations and backward compatibility.
  - Be careful with auto-transfer logic to avoid mass incorrect ticket moves; prefer conservative behavior by default.
  - Respect existing permission settings: the plugin must not transfer tickets in ways that violate osTicket policies or role-based access.
- **Integrations and dependencies**: changes that affect departments or queues must be aligned with the core and must not break manual ticket transfer flows.
- **Stack**:
    - PHP 8.2
    - osTicket: 1.18
